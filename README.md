#  Smart City Traffic Data Analysis

This project analyzes traffic patterns in two Indian smart cities — **Delhi** and **Lucknow** — using curated datasets. It identifies peak traffic hours, accident-prone zones, and generates visual insights using Python and Power BI.

## Project Structure:-


## Tools Used:-

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** for exploratory data analysis
- **Google Colab** for coding in the cloud
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards
- **GitHub** for version control

## Key Insights

- **Peak Traffic Hours** visualized using line charts
- **Accident Prone Areas** by location-based density
- **City-wise comparison** of queue and stop density trends

## Power BI Dashboard (To be added)

The `.pbix` dashboard includes:
- Heatmaps of accidents by time & location
- Bar charts of queue density by hour
- Comparison visuals for both cities
